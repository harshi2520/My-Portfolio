     This project involved building an interactive and scalable dashboard using Advanced Excel and Power Query to analyze over 9,700 e-commerce orders valued at $63.7M. Key KPIs like total profit ($3.25M) and profit margin (5%) were tracked and visualized effectively. The analysis highlighted growth opportunities through product category insights, geographic trends, and seasonal patterns. Insights derived from the dashboard directly improved marketing ROI by 30%, increased customer engagement by 25%, and supported an 18% rise in peak-season sales through strategic inventory and campaign optimization.
