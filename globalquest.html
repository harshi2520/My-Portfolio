    During my internship at Global Quest Technologies, I built a strong foundation in Java programming and object-oriented design. I completed 85% of the core Java training modules and played a key role in initiating the application's architecture. I authored over 50 Java classes, implementing 40% of the prototypeâ€™s planned functionality. My work was highly collaborative, with a 90% success rate in resolving merge conflicts via Git/GitHub, and I contributed to sprint planning and complete documentation of development processes.
