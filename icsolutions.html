    At IC Solutions, I specialized in front-end development for hospitality applications, where I designed responsive user interfaces that improved event management efficiency by 30%. I introduced automation into user profile workflows, reducing data loss by 80%, and enriched user experience by integrating dynamic HTML/CSS and online support tools. These improvements led to a 25% boost in user satisfaction, reflecting my ability to combine design aesthetics with technical performance.
