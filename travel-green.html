A redesigned registration flow improved onboarding success to 95%. The mobile app integrates Google Maps SDK for 90% navigation accuracy. Additionally, the launch of a carbon-credit marketplace increased trade volume by 60%, with bank approval times reduced by 40%. An in-app leaderboard and social sharing features further drove user engagement by 35%.
